# Portfolio

## About me
I am a Software Test Engineer with a strong background in all phases of the software development life cycle. My expertise lies in requirements gathering, test planning, test case development, test execution (manual and automated), trace matrices, and reporting. Throughout my career, I have gained extensive experience working with various technologies and tools.

In addition to my technical skills, I possess a Bachelor's degree in Political Science. Although it may seem unrelated, the skills I acquired during my degree program have proven to be highly transferable to my role as a software quality professional. My studies in Political Science honed my critical thinking, analytical, and problem-solving abilities, allowing me to approach software testing with a well-rounded perspective. I am adept at understanding complex systems, analyzing data, and making informed decisions, all of which are essential in ensuring the delivery of high-quality software within project timelines.

I have a strong understanding of Agile/Scrum and Waterfall methodologies and can effectively adapt to different project environments. I excel in defect tracking, utilizing tools such as Jira, Serena Business Manager, and Radar to manage and resolve issues comprehensively. I am well-versed in regulatory compliance, including FDA and ISO standards like IEC 62304, ISO 13485, ISO 14971, 21 CFR Part 820, and Part 11, ensuring that software products meet the required industry guidelines.

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated excellent problem-solving and decision-making abilities. I am passionate about delivering quality and data-driven results, consistently striving for excellence in every project I undertake. With a combination of technical expertise, a solid understanding of software development methodologies, and the transferable skills gained from my degree in Political Science, I bring a unique perspective and a strong foundation to any QA Engineering role.
